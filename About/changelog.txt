1.1.1 - Fixed major bugs related to Better Architect Menu dependency.
1.1.2 - Many small balance changes and bugfixes. Shelves have been moved back to their vanilla medieval technology, and stack sizes everywhere else has been tweaked down to match. Description/readme has the new guidelines used for these balance changes.
