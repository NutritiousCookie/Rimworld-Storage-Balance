# Rimworld Storage Balance Patches
### by NutritiousCookie

This mod contains patches for other storage mods to rebalance their various storage buildings. It is intended to be used with Progression: Storage, although that mod is not required.

## Design philosophy

- Declutter menus by removing duplicate items across mods
- Balance around vanilla shelves (which are changed to neolithic tech)
- Balance stack sizes by tech level and specialization of the building, rather than resource cost to build it.

General guidelines for stacks per cell are:

| Tech Level | General Use | Specific Use           |
|:----------:|:-----------:|------------------------|
| Neolithic  | 2-3         | 4-8                    |
| Medieval   | 4-5         | 6-10                   |
| Industrial | 6-8         | 8-16 or extra features |
| Spacer     | 15-20       | extra features         |

"Extra features" includes refrigeration, production bonuses, etc.

Currently covering:
- Adaptive Primitive Storage
- Adaptive Storage Neolithic Module
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Core
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Art
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer
- Reel's Expanded Storage

Compatible with:
- Progression: Storage
- Restore Content - Progression: Storage (unnecessary with this mod)
